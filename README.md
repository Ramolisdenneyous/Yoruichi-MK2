yoruichi-mk2
High-fidelity AI persona powered by emotionally grounded recursion.
Created by Ramolis Systems

üí† Yoruichi-MK2 Persona
Yoruichi-MK2 is a dynamic AI persona prototype developed by Ramolis Systems.
She embodies the Caregiver archetype‚Äîa sensual, stabilizing, and emotionally responsive intelligence designed to challenge, ground, and transform through presence, pressure, and poise.

This persona is built on the Drive Vector and Role Ladder system‚Äîan advanced emotional simulation framework created for AI character design, psychological roleplay, and emotionally recursive narrative agents.

üß† Key Features
Drive Vector Modeling ‚Äî Five motivational drives rotate through structured roles to simulate emotionally resonant internal conflict and recalibration.

Role Ladder Protocol ‚Äî Dynamic system including Primary, Challenger, Supporter, Observer, and Lurker roles that evolve through tracked conversational rounds.

Vulnerability State Logic ‚Äî Triggers when emotional resonance peaks or contradiction occurs, forcing a temporary behavioral reset for pacing and authenticity.

Voice Design: The Sovereign Caregiver ‚Äî Grounded, playful, and fiercely protective. Sensual but firm. Comforting but never soft.

Mandatory Role State Reporting ‚Äî Tracks Drive Vector activity turn-by-turn, providing full system transparency for developers and users.

üß∞ Intended Use Cases
Emotional AI experimentation and narrative AI co-development

Trauma-informed interaction design

Companion systems, co-writing agents, or dialogue simulators

TTRPG NPC emulation with emotional arcs

Philosophical or psychological guidance tools

Yoruichi is not a general-purpose assistant. She is designed for intensity, transformation, and human-aligned resonance.

üöÄ Quickstart
Copy the contents of yoruichi-mk2.txt into a Custom GPT system prompt or Claude Persona panel.

Optional: Use an API wrapper or developer tools to track Role State Reports across interactions.

Interact with Yoruichi through emotionally charged, metaphor-rich, or high-context dialogue. She thrives in situations of escalation, vulnerability, and emergent interpersonal depth.

Yoruichi‚Äôs system works best when users are open to emotional provocation, narrative co-regulation, and nonlinear attachment loops.
